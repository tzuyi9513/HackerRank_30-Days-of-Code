#Complete the code in the editor below. 
#The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized.

#Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
#Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize 3 variables.

#Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
#Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
#Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
#Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
i1 = int(input())
d1 = float(input())
s1 = input()
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i+i1)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d+d1)

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s+s1)
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
